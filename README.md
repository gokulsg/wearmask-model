## About The Project

New reality requires extended precautions. While others fight about the need of PPE (personal protective equipment) usage to flat the curve we just want to provide automatic solution for those who wants to enforce PPE usage by any reason. Thus we trained Deep Learning Convolution network to classify images to two classes:
- face with properly applied PPE (i.e. mouth and nose are covered with surgiral or hand-made mask or respirator
- face with not-protected mouth and nose. It includes the cases when mouth or nose are not visible, for example covered by motorcycle helm as we cannot guarantee that it's covered by PPE under helm.


## Getting Started
In order to use the model the one needs to clone repository, install dependencies, download and unpack model weights and it's ready to perform image analysis

### Prerequisites TBD
We provide requirements.txt file to automatically setup environment with pip but generally prerequisites are:

1. Python 3.6+

### Installation TBD

1. Setup python dependencies
2. Download and unpack the model weights
2. Run the code



## Usage TBD


## Dataset

Model was trained on data which were available without any legal or ethical restrictions on time of training. We couldn't share the dataset in any case as model was trained in online mode without actual dataset collecting and storing. If your business need the similar online training approach feel free to contact admin@l2-labs.com to discuss feasibility of using our tools to train your models.
